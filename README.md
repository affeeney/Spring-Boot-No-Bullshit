# Spring Boot No Bullshit

## Overview

This project is a backend service built using **Spring Boot**, focusing on creating a clean and modular architecture for handling web requests, implementing exception handling, and providing API endpoints. The project aims to refine skills in **abstraction** and **modularity**, alongside improving expertise in **API design**, **testing**, and **security**.

## Features

- **Centralized Repository:** The application follows the **repository pattern** to abstract data access, providing a centralized layer for handling interactions with databases or other data sources.
- **Web Request Handling:** Efficient handling of web requests using Spring Boot controllers and services to manage business logic.
- **Exception Handling:** Robust exception management is implemented using a global exception handler, ensuring errors are handled consistently across the service.
- **API Endpoints:** Provides various RESTful API endpoints to expose business functionalities.
- **Testing:** Implements unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
- **Security:** Basic security measures like authentication and authorization are integrated using Spring Security.

## Key Concepts and Skills Refined

- **Abstraction and Modularity:** The project emphasizes a **modular approach** in organizing code, ensuring that components like services, repositories, and controllers remain loosely coupled and easily maintainable.
- **API Endpoints:** Gained experience in designing RESTful APIs using Spring Boot with appropriate HTTP methods and status codes, ensuring a clean and intuitive API design.
- **Testing:** The project includes **unit tests** for individual components (services, controllers, etc.) and **integration tests** to validate the interaction between components.
- **Exception Handling:** Utilized global exception handling to manage errors across the service, making error responses consistent and user-friendly.
- **Security:** Implemented basic authentication and authorization mechanisms using Spring Security to ensure the application is secure.
